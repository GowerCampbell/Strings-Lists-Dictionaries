# Python Programming Notes: Strings, Lists, and Dictionaries

Welcome to my Python programming notes repository! This repository contains detailed explanations and code examples for working with **strings**, **lists**, and **dictionaries** in Python. These notes are written in my own words and have been improved for clarity and correctness.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my notes and code examples for understanding and working with Python's core data structures: **strings**, **lists**, and **dictionaries**. Each concept is broken down into simple explanations, accompanied by practical examples and pseudocode.

## Flowchart Symbols

Flowcharts are a great way to visualize algorithms and processes. Here are the symbols I use:

| Symbol | Meaning                     | Example Usage                          |
|--------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `()`   | Start/End                   | Represents the beginning or end of a process. |
| `->`   | Arrows                      | Represents an action or calculation.   |
| `/ /`  | Input/Output                | Represents input and output operations. |
| `[ ]`  | Process                     | Represents a condition for outcomes.   |
| `â†µ<>â†´` | Decision                    | Represents a Boolean decision (Yes/No or True/False). |

## Data Structures

Data structures are organized ways to store and manage data efficiently. They are essential for accessing, organizing, and modifying information easily, which is crucial for problem-solving.

### Lists/Arrays

Lists (or arrays) are ordered collections of elements. They use an **index** to access elements by their position. In programming, the first index is `0`, not `1`.

- **Key Features**:
  - Indexing: Direct access to elements using indices (e.g., `list[0]`).
  - Contiguity: Stored in adjacent memory locations for fast access.
  - Mutability: Elements can be added, removed, or modified.

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are collections of **key-value pairs**. Each key maps to a value. Dictionaries are unordered and accessed using keys, not indices.

- **Key Features**:
  - Keys must be immutable (e.g., strings, numbers).
  - Values can be of any data type.
  - Fast lookups using keys.

### Stacks

Stacks follow the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. The last element added is the first to be removed.

- **Operations**:
  - Push: Add an element to the top.
  - Pop: Remove the top element.
  - Peek: View the top element without removing it.

### Queues

Queues follow the **First In, First Out (FIFO)** principle. The first element added is the first to be removed.

- **Operations**:
  - Enqueue: Add an element to the rear.
  - Dequeue: Remove the front element.
  - Peek: View the front element without removing it.

## String Handling

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes. Common operations include **concatenation**, **slicing**, and **formatting**.

- **Key Methods**:
  - `strip()`: Removes whitespace from the beginning and end.
  - `replace()`: Replaces substrings.
  - `split()`: Breaks a string into a list.
  - `join()`: Combines a list into a string.

## Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a planning tool for algorithms. It uses simple language to describe the logic of a solution before writing actual code.

- **Example**: Finding the largest number in a list.
  ```
  SET max = first number in list
  FOR each number in list
      IF number > max THEN
          SET max = number
  END FOR
  PRINT max
  ```

## List Comprehension

List comprehension is a concise way to create lists by applying an operation to each element.

- **Example**: Converting strings to integers.
  ```python
  num_list = ['1', '5', '8', '14', '25', '31']
  new_num_list_ints = [int(element) for element in num_list]
  print(new_num_list_ints)  # Output: [1, 5, 8, 14, 25, 31]
  ```

## Copying Lists

There are two ways to copy lists: **shallow copy** and **deep copy**.

- **Shallow Copy**: Copies the outer list but not nested lists.
- **Deep Copy**: Copies all nested lists as well.
